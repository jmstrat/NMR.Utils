\title{Read NMR Data}
\usage{
read.NMR(nmrfile, imaginary_file = NA, mass = 1,
  nucleus = "Unknown Nucleus", acqus = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{nmrfile}{Path to txt file saved using topspin's File->Save as->Save data of currently displayed region in a text file. Or a directory of files (see above)}

\item{nucleus}{The nucleus to which the data corresponds}

\item{acqus}{The path to the directory containing the acqus file for the data}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the NMR data (ppm,intensity1, ...)
}
\description{
This function is used to import 1D or 2D NMR data.
To import 1D data, you must export it from topspin.
2D data may be imported by passing the path to the directory, provided it has been processed using topspin (this allows for imaginary data to be imported) (Doesn't yet work!).
}
\details{
If a folder is passed as the parameter to nmrfile, read.NMR will attempt to guess whether it is a folder containing individual scans from an in-situ experiement, a folder containing raw data or a folder containing 1D spectra to be summed. It will then process accordingly.
}
\examples{
read.NMR("/path/to/file.txt")
read.NMR("/path/to/nmr/expName/expNo")
read.NMR("/path/to/folder/")
}
